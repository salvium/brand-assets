# Salvium MidJourney Visual Style Guide

## Introduction

The power of a movement is in its symbols, and Salvium's visual identity is no different. We've crafted a unique aesthetic—cyber-noir vibes, circuit-patterned reflective materials, cyan glows—that captures the spirit of an urban tech warrior.

By sharing a specific MidJourney style reference (`--sref 695992723`) with our community, we empower everyone to contribute. This guide shows you how to create visual content that is consistent with Salvium’s identity, while expressing your own creative voice.
